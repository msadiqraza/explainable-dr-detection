# Explainable Diabetic Retinopathy Detection System

![DR Detection](path_to_project_banner.png) <!-- Optional: Add a project banner -->

## Overview
An end-to-end system for detecting diabetic retinopathy in retinal images with built-in explainability features. The system combines deep learning for detection with advanced visualization and natural language explanations to provide transparent and interpretable results.

## Key Features
* Diabetic Retinopathy detection using deep learning models
* Model explainability using XAIN (Explainable AI Network)
* Grad-CAM visualization for highlighting critical image regions
* Custom NLP model for generating natural language explanations
* Lightweight, user-friendly frontend interface

## Technical Architecture
* **Backend**: Python-based ML pipeline
* **Deep Learning Model**: ResNet50 for DR classification
* **Explainability Tools**: 
  - XAIN implementation
  - Grad-CAM visualization
  - Custom NLP explanation generator
* **Frontend**: Lightweight web interface
